# My Portfolio
A portfolio of personal projects. Everything is expressed in code where possible.

## Projects

### Personal Website
My personal website, currently available at [speerporfolio.com](https://speerportfolio.com/), is meant to be an extension of my resume with details of personal projects and professionl experiences.

Components:

 - [Frontend](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/tree/main/projects/website/speerportfolio) is written in Typescript and uses `yarn` and the CRA framework.
 - [GH Actions](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/actions) deployment pipelines.
