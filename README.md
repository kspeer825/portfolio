# My Portfolio
A portfolio of personal projects. Everything is expressed in code.

## Projects

### Personal Website
[This](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/tree/main/projects/website/) is my personal website currently available at [speerporfolio.com](https://speerportfolio.com/). It's meant to be an extension of my resume with details of personal projects and professionl experiences.

The terraform for the infrastrucutre is located [here](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/tree/main/projects/website/infra#s3-static-website-infrastructure), while details for the frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/tree/main/projects/website/speerportfolio).
It is hosted in AWS using Cloudfront, S3, and ACM. The frontend is built using React and Typescript. I have professional
experience with React apps, but I am not a frontend dev. The site is very simple, a client-side SPA made up of a few React components.
