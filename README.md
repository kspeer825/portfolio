# My Portfolio
A portfolio of personal projects. Everything is expressed in code.

## Projects

### Personal Website
[This](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/tree/main/projects/website/) is my personal website currently available at [speerporfolio.com](https://speerportfolio.com/). It's meant to be an extension of my resume with details of personal projects and professionl experiences.

Components:
 - [Infra](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/tree/main/projects/website/infra#s3-static-website-infrastructure) relies on Terraform and includes a Makefile.
 - [Frontend](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/tree/main/projects/website/speerportfolio) is written in Typescript and uses `yarn` and the CRA framework.
 - [GH Actions](https://github.com/kspeer825/portfolio/actions) deployment pipelines.
