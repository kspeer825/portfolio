# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions
Advent of Code [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Each year I try to complete the latest [advent calendar](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) using a languge that is new to me, or that I want more practice in.

This year I used Python.

## Soutions
The solutions for each day are located in the corresponding .py file i.e. Dec 1st -> day_one.py.
One :star: indicates Part 1 is completed, 2 :star:'s indicate Parts 1 and 2 are completed.
