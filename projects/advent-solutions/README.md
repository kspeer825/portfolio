## Advent of Code Solutions
Each year I try to complete the latest [advent calendar](https://adventofcode.com/) using a languge that is new to me, or that I want more practice in.

I have organized my solutions from each year with a docker container and Makefile, so anyone can reproduce the output. This is a pattern that I have used professionally that simplifies local developement without too much abstraction.

| Year | Language | Source                                                                                                                                          |
