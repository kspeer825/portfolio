# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions
Each year I try to complete the latest [advent calendar](https://adventofcode.com/) using a languge that is new to me, or that I want more practice in.

This year I used Python.

The solutions for each day are located in the corresponding .py file i.e. Dec 1st -> day_one.py

## Execution
Build container
```
make docker-build
```
Execute solution
```
make solve day=<[one,two,twenty_five,etc]>
```

## Requirements
 - [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Simple-Makefile)
 - Docker and its runtime env like Docker Desktop or [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)
